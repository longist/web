        <h1>Chant of Light</h1>
        <p>
        Maker, though the darkness comes upon me,<br>
        I shall embrace the Light. I shall weather the storm.<br>
        I shall endure.<br>
        What you have created, no one can tear asunder.<br></p>
        <p>
        Who knows me as You do?<br>
        You have been there since before my first breath.<br>
        You have seen me when no other would recognize my face.<br>
        You composed the cadence of my heart.<br>
        <p>
        Through blinding mist, I climb<br>
        A sheer cliff, the summit shrouded in fog, the base<br>
        Endlessly far beneath my feet<br>
        The Maker is the rock to which I cling.<br></p>
        <p>
        I cannot see the path.<br>
        Perhaps there is only abyss.<br>
        Trembling, I step forward,<br>
        In darkness enveloped.<br></p>
        <p>
        Though all before me is shadow,<br>
        Yet shall the Maker be my guide.<br>
        I shall not be left to wander the drifting roads of the Beyond.<br>
        For there is no darkness in the Maker's Light<br>
        And nothing that He has wrought shall be lost.<br></p>
        <p>
        I am not alone. Even<br>
        As I stumble on the path<br>
        With my eyes closed, yet I see<br>
        The Light is here.<br></p>
